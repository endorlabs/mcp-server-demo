# 🧬 Endor Labs MCP Vibe Template

This repo is a minimal setup to kickstart secure, AI-assisted development using Cursor, GitHub, and Endor Labs MCP.

It includes:

✅ .cursor/ — Cursor agent policy rules (MCP rules)

✅ .github/ — Baseline GitHub config

✅ .vscode/ — VS Code project settings

🧪 Preconfigured MCP server setup and Copilot instructions

Repo: github.com/endorlabs/mcp-server-demo

🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/endorlabs/mcp-server-demo.git
cd mcp-server-demo

2. Open it in Cursor

Launch Cursor and open this repo folder. Make sure agent mode is enabled.

No additional configuration needed — the MCP server and policy files are already set up.

## 🧠 Try This Demo Prompt

In Cursor, paste this into the agent:

```yaml
“Create a TODO list app with a React frontend and Python backend.The app must support creating Todo items with an expiration date and have the ability to delete items from the Todo list.”
```

MCP will:

Scan generated code

Check for risky dependencies

Flag security issues

Help you vibe responsibly
