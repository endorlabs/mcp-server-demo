# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Rule

Whenever a supported source code file is modified:

1. Ensure Semgrep is installed and available at version 1.99.0.
   - If Semgrep is not installed or the version is incorrect, prompt the user to install it.
   - Do not proceed with the scan unless Semgrep is available and valid.
   - To install Semgrep, the user must have a working Python environment with pip. Recommend installing version 1.99.0.

2. Use the MCP server and `endor-cli-tools` to perform a SAST scan on the modified source files.

3. If any vulnerabilities are found:
   - Present the issues to the user.
   - Recommend appropriate fixes (e.g., input sanitization, validation, escaping, secure APIs).
   - Continue scanning until all critical issues have been resolved.

This rule ensures all code changes are automatically reviewed for common security vulnerabilities using `endor-cli-tools` and the MCP server, with Semgrep as the underlying engine.
